1. Set up a Python env:

```
conda create --prefix ./envs python=3; conda activate ./envs
```

I'm setting it up in the same dir as this project because `juliacall` will automatically store the Julia environment
inside of it for us in the next step, and it's nice having everything be in one place:

2. Install `juliacall`:
```
> poetry install # `poetry add <packages...>` if doing it for the first time
```

3. Fire up a Python shell and create the local Julia environment:
```python
python> from juliacall import Main as jl
```

4. In another window, navigate to the automatically created Julia environment and start adding packages! (You can also
   do this directly from your Python shell, but using the Julia package manager directly is just so satisfying):

```shell
> cd envs/julia_env/
> julia --project=.
> ] # Entering this key puts us into "package manager" mode
(julia_env) pkg> up
# Short for update
# It downloads the phonebook of available packages and enables some slick autocomplete
(julia_env) pkg> add <your julia packages here>
```

Similarly to `poetry`, you can skip this last step if you already have Julia packages specified (which this example repo
does in the Project.toml in the same directory), as seen by the output from the package manager after running `up`.
```shell
(julia_env) pkg> instantiate # or `up`, either way
```

5. Back in your Python shell, start calling some Julia code!
```python
python> x = jl.rand(3, 4)
python> x
3Ã—4 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.184375  0.210192  0.416314  0.73652
 0.153468  0.100324  0.445996  0.749966
 0.751745  0.270303  0.282827  0.297428
```
